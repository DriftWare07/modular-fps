This is an fps project that endeavors use extendable scripts and resources to handle weapons cleanly.

To make a weapon:

Create a new weaponresource
Set the model, recoil curves and other data.
Go to the player scene, find the weaponhandler node, and drop your new resource into the weaponlist array.
